\title{Person-total correlation}
\usage{
ptcor(x, ref, mu = NULL, missargs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data (matrix or dataframe) of interest.}

\item{ref}{reference sample (matrix or dataframe). Must have same number of columns as \code{x}.}

\item{mu}{(Optional) Vector of means that could be used instead of the reference sample.}

\item{missargs}{(Experimental/Optional) A list of arguments for handling missing data. Currently
a list of two elements \code{missingmethod} and \code{idx_nonmiss} are accepted. Details will
later document how these work. This part is likely to change and only handles missing
values in the reference sample.}
}
\value{
Vector of person-total correlations. Undefined values default to -1.
}
\description{
Calculates the person-total correlation with respect to some reference sample.
}
\details{
Computes person-total correlation for each row in \code{x} based on either the
references sample in \code{ref} or the means in \code{mu}. Lower values are
typically thought to be indicative of careless responders. A perfect +1
value indicates the ideal point.
}
\examples{
x = cnrexample1[1:10,]
anchor = cnrexample1[-(1:10),]
ptcor(x, anchor) # person total correlation of x wrt to anchor
