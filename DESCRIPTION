Title: Careless responding detection, nonparametric and unsupervised
Description: Detects full (i.e. all items) content-nonresponsivity in Likert-type data, using the nonparametric unsupervised algorithm in Ilagan & Falk (2023) <doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02246-7>. The algorithm has been extended to accommodate inventories whose items vary the number of response options.
